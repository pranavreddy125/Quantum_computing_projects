This project follows a Qiskit introductory tutorial to demonstrate a basic multi-qubit quantum circuit and the use of quantum observables.

A Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state is constructed and analyzed by measuring expectation values of different Pauli operators using Qiskit’s Estimator primitive. The results illustrate perfect correlations between qubits, a hallmark of multi-qubit entanglement.

The project demonstrates:
	•	construction of an n-qubit GHZ state
	•	use of Pauli observables (X, Z, and identity)
	•	expectation value estimation with Qiskit primitives
	•	visualization of correlations across observables
