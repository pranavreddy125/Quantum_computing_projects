This project implements a simple Quantum Random Number Generator using Qiskit. It's purpose was to test my ability to write code in Qiskit unassisted. 
Randomness is generated by measuring a qubit prepared in superposition, leveraging the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum measurement rather than classical pseudo-random algorithms. This is TRUE randomness.

The project serves as a foundational example of:
	•	quantum measurement–based randomness
	•	basic circuit construction in Qiskit
	•	the difference between classical and quantum sources of randomness
