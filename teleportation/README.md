This project implements the Quantum Teleportation protocol using Qiskit.
A randomly prepared single-qubit quantum state is transferred from one qubit (“Alice”) to another (“Bob”) using shared entanglement and classical communication, without physically moving the quantum state itself.

The implementation demonstrates:
	•	creation of a Bell pair (entanglement)
	•	Bell-state measurement
	•	classical feed-forward using conditional gates
	•	separation of quantum and classical information flow

The project illustrates how quantum information can be transmitted using entanglement and measurement, highlighting a core primitive used in quantum communication and distributed quantum computing.
